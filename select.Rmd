## faqs

* how to use [case when](#case-when)  
* how to use [having](#having)  
* how to do a grouped sum ???

## structure

```sql
select column_name(s)
from table_name
where condition
group by column_name(s)
having condition
order by column_name(s);
```

## clauses

### where {#where}

#### like

* the 'like' predicate is used to search for a string pattern in a column  
* the `%` is a wildcard character and represents 0 or more of any character and can be placed at the start or end of the pattern

```sql
select col1
from table
where col2 like 'asdf%';
```

```sql
select col1
from table
where col2 not like 'asdf%';
```

#### like any

```sql
select *
from table
where col like any (
  'this %',
  'that %'
)
```

#### and / or

```sql
select col1
from table
where (col2 = 1 or col2 = 2)
and (col3 = 'A' or col3 = 'B');
```

#### between and

Alternative to `col >= x and col <= y` (i.e. between is inclusive)

```sql
select col1
from table
where col2 between 1 and 2; 
```

#### in 

```sql
select col1
from table
where col2 in (1, 10, 100);
```

#### is

```sql
select col1
from table
where col2 is null;
```

```sql
select col1
from table
where col2 is not null;
```

#### comparison operators

```sql
select col1
from table
where col2 >= x and col2 <= y; 
```

### group by {#group-by}

```sql
select col, count(*)
from table
group by col;
```

### having {#having}

The having clause was added to SQL because the where keyword could not be used with aggregate functions.

```sql
select col1
from table
group by col1
having count(col2) > 10;
```

### order by {#order-by}

in ascending order by default

```sql
select col1
from table
order by col2, col3;
```

in descending order - using keyword `desc`

```sql
select col1
from table
order by col2 desc, col3;
```

by column position rather than name

```sql
select col1
from table
order by 2, 3;
```

*********************************************************************

## new variables

### aggregate functions

```sql
select count(*) as n
from table;
```

```sql
select count(col) * 100.0 / count(*) as asdf
from table;
```

```sql
select 
  avg(col) as avg, 
  max(col) as max, 
  sum(col) as sum
from table;
```

### case when {#case-when}

```sql
case
    when condition1 then result1
    when condition2 then result2
    ...
    when conditionN then resultN
    else result0
end;
```
